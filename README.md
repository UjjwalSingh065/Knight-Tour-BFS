# Knight-Tour-BFS
Knight Tour problem Solving using breadth first algorithm
This project solves the well known Knight tour problem by using the breadth first algorithm in the data structure tree.
first it takes initial cell of knight on the chess board and then traverses all the adjacent cells on which the knight can move and add them to a queue 
then it checks whether the visited cell is destination cell or not .
if the destination is found it returns the number of steps to required to reach the destination cell otherwise it shows that destination cell is not present in chess board.
